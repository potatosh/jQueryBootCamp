        <h2>Apple</h2>
        <p>
          The apple is the pomaceous fruit of the apple tree, species Malus domestica in the rose family (Rosaceae).
          It is one of the most widely cultivated tree fruits, and the most widely known of the many members of genus
          Malus that are used by humans. Apples grow on small, deciduous trees. The tree originated in Western Asia,
          where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years
          in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have been present in the
          mythology and religions of many cultures, including Norse, Greek and Christian traditions. In 2010, the fruit's
          genome was decoded, leading to new understandings of disease control and selective breeding in apple production.

        <h2>Blueberry</h2>
        <p>
          Blueberries are perennial flowering plants of the genus Vaccinium (a genus which also includes cranberries
          and bilberries), with indigo-colored berries. Species in the section Cyanococcus are the most common fruits
          sold as "blueberries" and are native to North America (commercially cultivated highbush blueberries
          were not introduced into Europe until the 1930s).
          They are usually erect but sometimes prostrate shrubs varying in size from 10 centimeters (3.9 in) to
          4 meters (13 ft) tall. In commercial blueberry production, smaller species are known as "lowbush blueberries"
          (synonymous with "wild"), and the larger species are known as "highbush blueberries".

        <h2>Citrus</h2>
        <p>
          Citrus is a common term and genus (Citrus) of flowering plants in the rue family, Rutaceae. Citrus is believed
          to have originated in the part of Southeast Asia bordered by Northeastern India, Myanmar (Burma) and the Yunnan
          province of China. Citrus fruit has been cultivated in an ever-widening area since ancient times; the best-known
          examples are the oranges, lemons, grapefruit, and limes.
